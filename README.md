An interpreter/compiler for a programming language we're probably going to create

Features:
Style as syntax - enforce rules for whitespace, etc.
Strong typing of variables
Generator expressions (a la Python)
Basic object oriented programming
Function overloading
Operator definitions within classes (i.e. allow classes to define +, -, /, *)
