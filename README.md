Ambroscum
=========

An interpreter/compiler for a scripting language heavily based on Python, with influences from Java.

Planned Features:
- Style as syntax - enforce rules for whitespace, etc.
- Strong typing of variables
- Generator expressions (a la Python)
- Basic object oriented programming
- Operator definitions within classes (i.e. allow classes to define +, -, /, *)
- Interactive (shell) mode, as well as executable (non-interactive) mode
